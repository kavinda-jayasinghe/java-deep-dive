thread schedular  decide context switching

in production dont use start
callable - has return type...runnable and thread class return type is void
checked(compile time) and unchecked(run time- ecxeption(null,arrayoutofbound,arithmatic)



start run difference
start create new thread,run not create new thread the
can start call twice- NO


thread safety - ,multiple thread use correctly
sleep and wait diff
